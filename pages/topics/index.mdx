## Welcome!

Hi, I'm Marcy Sutton Todd and I'm pleased to be your instructor. I've worked as a frontend developer since 2009 including stints on the Angular, axe-core, and Gatsby teams. I've worked on many website and web application projects, increasing my knowledge of accessibility along the way. I'll share what I've learned so you can increase the level of accessibility on your own projects!
